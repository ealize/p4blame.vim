Installation: copy to .vim/plugins folder, set the p4pr.pl path correctly
p4pr.pl is required to perform the magic. Can be obtained from http://public.perforce.com/guest/fredric_fredricson/P4DB/rel/2.1/p4pr.perl

Mapped to: <C-b>

Would not be possible without Jony Wareing's SvnBlame [ https://github.com/Jonty/svnblame.vim.git ]
